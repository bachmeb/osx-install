## Requirements

* Hold the Option key and click the Purchases tab. You should see the versions of OS X you've previously purchased. 
  * [The Mac App Store normally displays OS X as being "Installed" in the purchases pane. This prevents you from downloading it when your Mac already has the same version of OS X installed. When you hold the Option key as you click the Purchases tab, the button to the right of the item you want to download should change to say "Install".](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202796)
* Select OS X Yosemite
* Click Download
* Wait....

##### Run the Install OS X app
*[This installer automatically opens after you download it. If you closed the installer app and need to re-open it, you can find it in the Applications folder.]()*

##### Follow the onscreen instructions in the Installer window to complete the installation. 
* When you're asked to select a drive for installation, click the button "Show All Disks." Select your external drive, then click Continue.
* Your Mac might restart one or more times during installation. After installation is finished, your Mac automatically starts up from the external drive.
